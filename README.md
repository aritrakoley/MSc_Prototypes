# IMPLEMENTATION OF HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGNITION BY TRAINING AND DEPLOYING A NEURAL NETWORK TO AN ANDROID APPLICATION

An Android application that takes an image as input and attempts to read the text written on it. Most of the details for the working and usage of this application can be found in the pdf files.
This project originally started as the Major Project for my Master's Course.  
P.S. : This readme will be updated as and when required to reflect changes to the project and add more details about it.
